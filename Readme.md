# Quantum Learn (QLearning)
This project aims to create an online platform to teach and learn about quantum computing through the collaboration of community and experts in the area.

# Principal ideas
- The platform will have two types of users: students and teachers.
- Teachers will be able to upload exercises to teach a specific topic about quantum computing.
- Students will be able to solve an exercise, take a learning path or a course.
- The learning resources will have a different set of methods that the teacher considered: text, code, video, documentation or links. (More could be added)
- The learning paths, courses or specific topics will have challenges to earn rewards.
