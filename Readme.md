# Quantum Learn (QLearning)
This project aims to create an online platform to teach and learn about quantum computing through the collaboration of community and experts in the area.

This will also serve as a platform to give a central point to show new people the wide range of areas in quantum computing and help them explore through learning resources and the passionate community.

# Principal ideas
- The platform will have two types of users: students and teacher.
- Teacher will be able to upload exercises to teach a specific topic about quantum computing.
- Students will be able to solve an exercise, take a learning path or a course.
- The learning resources will have a different set of methods that the teacher considered: text, code, video, documentation or links. (More could be added)
- The learning paths, courses or specific topics will have challenges to earn rewards.
- Students will be abe to take challenges of a topic and unluck rewards. (Stickers, UI themes, learning resources, contacts)
- Teacher will be able to showcase its knowledge, mentor and migth get talent.
- Students will be able to rate and comment the learning resources to bring teacher feedback.
