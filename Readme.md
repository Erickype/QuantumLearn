# Quantum Learn (QLearning)
This project aims to create an online platform to teach and learn about quantum computing through the collaboration of community and experts in the area.

This will also serve as a platform to give a central point to show new people the wide range of areas in quantum computing and help them explore through learning resources and the passionate community.

# Principal ideas
- The platform will have two types of users: students and teacher.
- Teacher will be able to upload exercises to teach a specific topic about quantum computing.
- Students will be able to solve an exercise, take a learning path or a course.
- The learning resources will have a different set of methods that the teacher considered: text, code, video, documentation or links. (More could be added)
- The learning paths, courses or specific topics will have challenges to earn rewards.
- Students will be abe to take challenges of a topic and unluck rewards. (Stickers, UI themes, learning resources, contacts)
- Teacher will be able to showcase its knowledge, mentor and migth get talent.
- Students will be able to rate and comment the learning resources to bring teacher feedback.

# Extracted requirements
- Role based user login.
- Learning resources needs multiple methods: text, code, video, documentation or links.
- Teachers can CRUD exercises.
- The group of learning resources create a learning path.
- The learning paths should have an appropiate sequence based on difficulty (based on an expert criteria).
- The learning paths will have some challenges to aprove a path. There is a minimun score to consider aproved.
- Learning paths can be updated by adding new challenges or topics.
- Students will be notified when a path they took was updated, however they won't lose the rewards previosly obtained. They still can get the new rewards.
- Students can role up in or path or take a single lesson.
- Students can only take paths based on its status. The status represents the level of knowledge considering the previous courses completed. 
- Students can earn a reward after completing a learning resource.
- Rewards can take several forms: text, UI, graphics, stickers, private lessons, community contacts.
- Students can rate and comments every learning resource they take.
- Teachers can track the performance of his learning resources.
